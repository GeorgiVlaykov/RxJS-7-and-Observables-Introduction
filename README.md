# RxJS-7-and-Observables-Introduction
## Course Description:
Have you joined a project which uses the Observables and RxJS and have no idea how to use it?
Are you already using RxJS and Observables and its behavior keeps surprising you?
Do you want to learn a new tool to conveniently handle asynchronous code?

If you responded YES to any of the above questions, then this might be a great course for you! RxJS is known to have a steep learning curve. There are many courses, articles, docs on the Internet which are great and cover a lot of complex RxJS scenarios, however I've noticed that it is difficult to start going and make first steps. Also, many experienced RxJS users still make some basic mistakes from time to time as they don't understand the mechanics of the Observables well.

This course will help you enter the world of RxJS in a slow step-by-step way. It might even help more advanced RxJS users fill the missing gaps in their understanding of the Observables and RxJS.
The objective of this course is to give you a great set of tools to start your RxJS journey!

You will learn here the core concepts of RxJS, such as:

- Observables

- Subscriptions

- Observers

- Creation Functions

- Pipeable Operators

- Subjects

The first sections of this course will present the basics of the Observables and RxJS in a slow and detailed way. We'll have a look at the idea of streams and reactive programming to understand how the data comes to us when using the Observables. I'll show you what kind of sources can we find in the world of Observables. You'll learn how can we execute an Observable by making Subscriptions, and how can we react to the notifications emitted by providing Observers. We'll use Marble Diagrams to present things in an easy to understand graphical way. There will also be a plenty of coding sections explaining each feature.

After we get the theory behind the Observables clarified, we'll move towards more practical uses of RxJS.
We'll use Creation Functions to easily create Observable from various sources like: arrays, DOM events, HTTP requests, timers, intervals and combining multiple Observables together. We'll use the Pipeable Operators to create more complex Observables.

Finally, we'll learn about the Subjects, which are a special type of Observable which allow us to conveniently emit a value to all Observers.

After you finish this course, you'll be able to start using the Observables and other RxJS tools in your apps and understand the articles, videos and docs on the Internet, so you can continue your RxJS journey.

Who this course is for:
- For those, who have just started working on a project which uses RxJS and Observables and have not used RxJS previously.
- For those, who already use Observables and RxJS, but it keeps surpising them and want to understand it better.
- For those, who find other courses and resources too complicated and who look for a slower, more detailed introduction into RxJS and Observables.
- For those, who look for more advanced tools for handling asynchronous code.
